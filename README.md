# Passphrase
This is a small JS function that performs two entirely separate, customizable, functions on a password field. <Br>
<Br>  
<H3>Function 1) - Changes the background color based on the complexity of the current password.</H3>
<Br>
<I>This function does NOT enforce complexity, merely encourages a stronger password.</I><Br>
<Br>
There are 4 available palettes, ranging from bright red to bright green, numbered from 1 – 4. 
<UL>
  <Li>‘1’ has five increments</Li>
  <Li>‘2’ has eight increments</Li>
  <Li>‘3’ had ten increments</Li>
  <Li>‘4’ has fourteen increments</Li>
  </UL>
  The more increments; the more complex a password required to achieve a bright green background.<Br>
<Br>
<H3>Function 2) – Requiring complexity rules</H3>
<Br>
<I>This function will not allow completion without satisfying it’s requirements.</I><Br><Br>

<UL>

  <Li>...</Li>
